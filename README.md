### Attendance-System-with-QR-Code

Enter the IDs of all the members in the array IDs and this program will mark their presence if they scan the QR code with their IDs as the message\n
This program will use your primary camera to scan the codes.\n
If you want it to terminate, scan a QR code with the message CLOSE and it will print out the attendance corresponding to the position of the ID in boolean.\n
This can be extended to storing/marking the attendance in a csv file\n
[QR code generator](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/) can be used to test this program out.\n
