### Attendance-System-with-QR-Code

Enter the IDs of all the members in the array IDs and this program will mark their presence if they scan the QR code with the message being their ID.<br />
This program will use the primary camera of your device to scan the codes.<br />
If you want it to terminate, scan a QR code with the message CLOSE and print a boolean array in the terminal with indices corresponding to the position of the ID.<br />
This can be extended to storing/marking the attendance in a csv file<br />
<br />
[QR code generator](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/) can be used to test this program out.
